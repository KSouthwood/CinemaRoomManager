# [Cinema Room Manager](https://hyperskill.org/projects/133)

## About
Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: a
good movie is a way to escape reality and live through a variety of
emotions. The best cinema experience you can get is probably in a cinema
theatre. In this project, you will crate an application that helps manage
a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats, see sales
statistics, and more.

## Learning Outcomes
This project is a good opportunity to work with input and output in Java.
You will deal with multi-dimensional arrays and functions as well as loops
and conditional statements.

### Stage 1: [Arrangement](https://hyperskill.org/projects/133/stages/709/implement)
#### _Visualize the seating arrangement by printing it to the console._
There are many enjoyable activities on this funny little planet Earth, and
still, the happiest, simplest, and most fulfilling one is probably going
to the movies. Going with friends, going with loved ones, experiencing a
while new adventure from the safety of a cinema seat, surrounded by
like-minded fellow travelers.

As a beginner developer, you can contribute to creating this wonderful
cinema experience. Your good friends asked you to help them create an
application for a cinema theatre where people can get tickers, reserve
seats, and enjoy their movie night.

### Stage 2: [Sold!](https://hyperskill.org/projects/133/stages/710/implement)
#### _Calculate the profit from all the sold tickets._
Good job! Our friends really liked your program! Now they want to expand
their theatre and add screen rooms with more seats. However, this is
expensive, so they want to make sure this will pay off. Help them
calculate the profit from all the sold tickets depending on the number of
available seats.

### Stage 3: [Tickets](https://hyperskill.org/projects/133/stages/711/implement)
#### _Set the ticket price._
When choosing a ticket you are guided not only by your space preference
but also by your finances. Let's implement the opportunity to check the
ticket price and see the reserved seat.

### Stage 4: [Menu, please!](https://hyperskill.org/projects/133/stages/712/implement)
#### _Add a menu that allows you to buy tickets and display the current state of the seating arrangement._
The theatre is getting popular, and the customers started complaining that
it's not practical that the program stops after buying one ticket. Let's
add a menu that will allow them to buy tickets and display the current
state of the seating arrangement when needed.

### Stage 5: [Errors!](https://hyperskill.org/projects/133/stages/713/implement)
#### _Handle some input errors._
Running a cinema theatre is no easy business. To help our friends, let's
add statistics to your program. The stats will show the current income,
total income, the number of available seats, and the percentage of occupancy.

in addition, our friends asked you to take care of a small inconvenience:
it's not good when a user can buy a ticket that has already been purchased
by another user. Let's fix this!
